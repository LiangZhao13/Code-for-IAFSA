# Improved-Artificial-Fish-Swarm-Algorithm
This is the MATLAB code for Improved Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (IAFSA). The code is used for global path planning of autonomous surface vessels.
The mathematical background of IAFSA is detailed descriped in the author's article *Route Planning for Autonomous Vessels based on Improved Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm*. The manuscript of the article is uploaded here.
